```javascript
// ...some Tailwind CSS classes...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md relative">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Resolved Issue</h2>
  <p>After careful review, we discovered a conflict between classes. Added more specificity to resolve the issue.</p>  
  <p>The solution involved simplifying class names and removing redundant ones.</p>
  <p>Adding a `relative` class in the parent element may help avoid conflicts with positioning.</p>
</div>
